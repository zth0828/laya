"""Supply-chain integrity for published checkpoints: opt-in pins and digest checks.

Runtime loaders keep the Hub default revision unless the caller supplies one. This preserves
compatibility with existing offline caches, including ``HF_HUB_OFFLINE=1`` deployments. The
reviewed commit SHAs below are available for callers that opt in, and every loader accepts an
optional SHA-256 map to verify artifact integrity before weights reach the runtime.

Both halves are reachable the same way. `expected_sha256` falls back to
``LAYA_SHA256_DIGESTS``, and `resolve_revision` falls back to ``LAYA_REVISION``: a commit, branch
or tag applied to every checkpoint load, or the word ``reviewed`` to use `PINNED_REVISIONS` for
whichever repository is being loaded. A `revision` argument still outranks the environment, and an
unset or empty ``LAYA_REVISION`` leaves today's behaviour exactly as it was, so a container pins
its checkpoints with one environment line and no code.

The env fallback is for checkpoints, i.e. the loads in this module's callers (`Agent`,
`ONNXAgent`). `common.build_model`'s training-time base-encoder load is deliberately excluded:
that is a different repository, and it has no reviewed SHA here to resolve to.
