"""Route a request to the Laya checkpoint best suited to it.

Three checkpoints, measured on a shared benchmark (17,416 questions, one T4, identical questions
per model -- see the repository's benchmark notebook):

  english          convaiinnovations/laya                421M  ModernBERT-large, 512 tokens
  multilingual     convaiinnovations/laya-multilingual   322M  mmBERT-base, 1024 tokens, 100+ langs
  typed-decisions  convaiinnovations/laya-typed-decisions 421M  ModernBERT-large, 1024 tokens,
                                                                fine-tuned on the typed-decisions
                                                                workflows

Why routing is worth it -- accuracy by language family:

                      english   multilingual
  MASSIVE intent  en    0.783       0.657        <- English checkpoint wins
  MASSIVE intent  non-en 0.306      0.451
  XNLI            en    0.860       0.843
  XNLI            non-en 0.521      0.731        <- +21 points for multilingual
  English suites        0.684       0.619

The English checkpoint does not gently degrade off English, it collapses: on 20-option MASSIVE
intent it scores 0.100 on Hindi and 0.103 on Korean, against 0.050 for random guessing -- and it
reports high confidence while doing so (ECE 0.855 on Hindi). Script detection is therefore the
primary routing signal.

`typed-decisions` is never selected automatically unless you opt in with
`auto_task_detection=True` or pass `task="typed_decisions"`: it is fine-tuned on four specific
synthetic workflows and should not be a silent default.

        r.predict({"message": "I was charged twice"}, questions)                 # -> english
        r.predict(state, questions, model="typed-decisions")                     # explicit

    Models are downloaded and built on first use. `max_loaded` caps how many stay resident
    (least-recently-used is evicted), because all three together are ~1.16B parameters.

    The default is 2, because automatic routing only ever chooses between `english` and
    `multilingual`: a cap of one rebuilds the checkpoint it just evicted on every script switch,
    which is seconds per request on exactly the traffic the Router exists for. Traffic that only
    ever sees one language never builds the second checkpoint, so the default costs it nothing.
    Lower it to 1 for a memory-constrained host, and raise it to 3 (or preload) when
    `auto_task_detection`, an explicit `model=` or an explicit `task=` can reach
    `typed-decisions` as well.

    For a server or a demo, preload instead: a cold load costs seconds, while detection costs
    microseconds, so even the default still pays a load the first time a language appears.

        r = Router(preload=True)                    # all three resident, routing is free
        r = Router(preload=True, device="cuda")
        r.preload(["english", "multilingual"])      # or just the two you serve

    Hub revisions are opt-in. `revision` applies one commit to every model;
    `revisions={"english": "...", "multilingual": "..."}` overrides that per model,
    which is useful when standalone repositories were reviewed at different commits.
    Without either, huggingface_hub's normal default and existing offline cache are used.

    Anything else `laya.Agent` accepts is reachable through `agent_kwargs`, which is merged into
    every checkpoint the Router builds:

        Router(agent_kwargs={"lang_temperatures": {"de": {"temperature": [1.0, 1.4, 2.0]}}})
        Router(agent_kwargs={"expected_sha256": {"model.safetensors": "a3f1..."}})
        Router(agent_kwargs={"fast": True})

    The names the Router sets for itself -- `model_id_or_path`, `device`, `token`, `subfolder`,
    `revision` and the hook arguments -- are refused here rather than silently shadowed, and the
    remaining names are checked against `Agent.__init__` at construction, so a misspelled option
    fails on the `Router(...)` line instead of on the first request.

    Artifact digests are opt-in and always per model: `sha256_digests={"english": {...}}`
    passes that `{path relative to the checkpoint dir: hexdigest}` map to the `Agent` that
    loads it, so a tampered or substituted weight file is refused before it is parsed. There
    is no Router-wide equivalent of `revision` because digests, unlike a commit SHA, are not
    shareable: the bundled repository ships a separate `model.safetensors` for each of
    `english`, `multilingual` and `typed-decisions`, so one flat map can only ever match one
    of them. A model listed with `None` or `{}` is loaded unverified.

    The same split is available to a process configured only by environment: when
    `LAYA_SHA256_DIGESTS` holds a model-keyed map (`{"english": {...}, "multilingual": {...}}`)
    this seeds it per checkpoint, so a server that keeps several resident can pin each with its
    own digests instead of refusing to start on the second one. A flat `LAYA_SHA256_DIGESTS`
    keeps its existing meaning, applied by `laya.revisions` to every checkpoint the process
    loads, which is right for a single-checkpoint one. An argument entry wins over the
    environment for the model it names.

    Hooks are opt-in and run at the Router level: `on_route` sees the routing decision,
    `on_load` / `on_evict` see model lifecycle, and `on_predict_start` / `on_predict_end`
    wrap the whole route+infer call. See `laya.hooks`.

        `predict` scores a state from a single window: anything past `max_len` is cut off (the
        first window, or for a conversation list the last) and never reaches the model. This
        routes exactly as `predict` does -- the same `model`/`task`/`lang` hints, the same
        router-level hooks, the same `routing` key and `usage` -- and scores the routed state with
        that agent's `predict_long`, which splits it into overlapping windows and aggregates per
        question. The aggregation rules are `laya.agent.Agent.predict_long`'s: `noul` takes the
        strongest window, `choice`/`score` the most confident one.

        Per-call hooks (`hooks`, `on_predict_start`, `on_predict_end`, `hooks_raise`,
        `hooks_timeout`) wrap the whole route+scan exactly as they wrap `predict`: the scan runs
        last, so a start hook that answers (`ctx.skip(...)`) or rewrites the state wins.
        `max_len` / `head_max_len` are not accepted here -- a window is sized by `window` or the
        checkpoint budget, and overriding the single-window truncation is what `predict_long` is for.

        Args:
            window: state tokens per window. Defaults to the routed checkpoint's budget
                    (`max_len - head_max_len - 8`); a smaller window isolates a localized span.
            stride: token step between windows; defaults to `window // 2` (50% overlap).
            aggregate: "auto" (the per-type rules above) is the only mode.
            batch_size: cap on windows per forward pass, to bound memory on very long states.

        Returns:
            The usual `predict` payload, with `usage["windows"]` counting the windows scored.

        Raises:
            TypeError: the routed agent has no `predict_long` (an ONNX agent, or one attached by
                    hand), so there is nothing to scan with. Raised under the router's

        Requests are routed first and grouped by checkpoint. Within each checkpoint,
        requests that share the same question schema are passed to
        ``Agent.predict_batch`` so their states can share forward passes. Results are
        then restored to the original request order.

        Requests may independently specify ``model``, ``task``, ``lang``,
        ``lang_guess``, ``max_len`` or ``head_max_len`` and may use different question schemas.
        ``max_len`` / ``head_max_len`` are the per-request form of the token-budget override
        ``predict`` takes as call arguments: they set the checkpoint's state and question-head
        budgets for that one request, so a wide question can be asked without shrinking the
        batch's other requests to the same window. Requests that ask for different budgets are
        split into separate forward passes, since one ``Agent.predict_batch`` call carries one
        budget for all its states. A start hook may still replace either value on ``ctx``.

        Router-level predict hooks run per request, as ``predict`` runs them: each request

        state, questions or token budget, or ``ctx.skip(...)`` it, and ``on_predict_end``
        sees and may replace its result. Requests are grouped for the forward pass after
        their start hooks have run, and a checkpoint group's requests end in reverse of the
        order they started. If a checkpoint group fails, every request of it whose start hook
        ran fails with the exception, a cache hit included: each gets ``on_error`` and then

            hooks_timeout: Override the Router's ``hooks_timeout`` for this call.
