        This is the throughput path. `system_one`/`predict` handle one state per forward pass; on a
        GPU that leaves most of the batch dimension idle. `predict_batch` collates several states'
        question rows into one tensor, so a call that would take N sequential forward passes takes
        one (or `ceil(len(states) / batch_size)`), which is several times faster per decision on GPU.

        Args:
            states: A list of states (each a text string, JSON dict, or conversation turn list).
                    The same `questions` are evaluated against every state.
            questions: Question definitions, exactly as accepted by `system_one`.
            batch_size: Optional cap on states per forward pass. `None` sends them all in one pass;
                        set it to bound peak memory when batching many or long states.
            hooks (HookArg): Per-call hooks, appended after any installed on the Agent.
                    See `laya.hooks`.
            on_predict_start (PredictHookArg): A per-call start hook. It may rewrite the
                    state/questions or call `ctx.skip(...)` to short-circuit inference.
            on_predict_end (PredictHookArg): A per-call end hook. It may rewrite the results.
            hooks_raise: Override the Agent's `hooks_raise` for this call.
            hooks_timeout: Override the Agent's `hooks_timeout` for this call.
            max_len: Override the agent config's `max_len` for this call. A start hook may also
                    set `ctx.max_len` to shape the token budget.
            head_max_len: Override the agent config's `head_max_len` for this call. A start hook
                    may also set `ctx.head_max_len`.
            sort_by_length: Group similarly sized encoded states within windows of eight batches
                    to reduce padding. Requires an explicit `batch_size` greater than one and
                    smaller than the number of states; otherwise it has no effect. Results retain
                    input order. This buffers up to eight batches of tokenized states instead of
                    one. Changing batch shapes can slightly change floating-point predictions.

        Returns:
            A list of per-state result dicts, each identical in shape to `system_one`'s output and
            aligned with `states` by index.

        """Evaluate questions over a state longer than the context window, scanning it in
        overlapping windows and aggregating per question.

        `system_one`/`predict` truncate a state that exceeds `max_len` to a single window (the
        first, or for a conversation list the last), silently dropping the rest. `predict_long`
        tokenizes the state once, splits it into overlapping token windows, scores every window in
        shared forward passes (via `predict_batch`), and combines the per-window answers:

          * noul  -> P(true) is the max over windows (the statement holds if any window supports it)
          * choice-> the answer from the single most-confident window, so a localized signal isn't
                     out-voted by the many neutral windows a long document is mostly made of
                     (averaging drowns it -- the neutral majority dominates)
          * score -> the level from the most-confident window, likewise

        The returned probability/confidence is the deciding window's, **not a calibrated number for
        the whole document**: a `noul` max over many windows drifts up with the window count even
        with no signal, and `choice` can land on a confidently-neutral window when nothing in the
        document is decisive. Each answer therefore carries `answer["window"]` — the deciding
        window's `index`, `token_start`/`token_end` into the tokenized state, and the window `count`
        — so a caller can inspect the span the answer came from rather than trust the raw number.

        A state that already fits one window is passed straight to `system_one` (identical output).

        The hooks wrap the inference that answers the state, which for a document needing several
        windows is the one shared `predict_batch` over them: `on_predict_start` fires once, and
        `ctx.states` holds the decoded window texts in scan order -- not the caller's `state`, which
        was tokenized to produce them. Three outcomes follow from what the chain leaves behind:

          * `ctx.skip([result])` answers the document: the payload comes back with no window
            attribution and `usage["windows"]` at 0, because nothing was scored
          * a scan left as this method built it: every window is scored, each answer carries
            `answer["window"]`, and `usage["windows"]` is the window count
          * a rewritten scan (`ctx.states` replaced, in any way): the answers are aggregated over
            the states that were scored, but no answer carries `answer["window"]` -- the offsets
            above describe this method's windows, not the text the model read

        Args:
            window: state tokens per window. Defaults to the per-question state budget
                    (`max_len - head_max_len - 8`) -- the most a window can hold for every question.
                    A smaller window isolates a localized signal better (a short deciding span is a
                    larger fraction of its window, so that window classifies it clearly), at the
                    cost of more windows; the large default favors context and throughput. `noul`
                    is robust to this, `choice`/`score` benefit from a smaller window when the
                    deciding span is a small part of a long, otherwise-neutral document.
            stride: token step between windows. Defaults to `window // 2` (50% overlap), so a span
                    near a boundary still lands whole inside some window.
            aggregate: "auto" (the per-type rules above) is the only mode for now.
            batch_size: cap on windows per forward pass, to bound memory on very long states.
            lang: per-language temperature selection, as in `system_one`.
            hooks (HookArg): Per-call hooks, appended after any installed on the Agent.
                    See `laya.hooks`.
            on_predict_start (PredictHookArg): A per-call start hook, as in `system_one`.
            on_predict_end (PredictHookArg): A per-call end hook, as in `system_one`.
            hooks_raise: Override the Agent's `hooks_raise` for this call.
            hooks_timeout: Override the Agent's `hooks_timeout` for this call.

        Returns a single result dict, the same shape as `system_one`, with `usage["windows"]` added.
        The key is always present and counts the windows the model scored to produce the answer: `1`
        for a state that fit one window, `N` for a document scanned in `N` overlapping windows (or
        the `N` a start hook rewrote them to), and `0` when a start hook answered the document, or
        left no states to score, before any window was read -- on either path, so a cached answer
        never reads as a window the model read.
