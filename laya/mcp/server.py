"""MCP stdio server exposing the Laya typed-decision tools.

Part of the optional ``laya[mcp]`` extra. Speaks MCP over stdio, so it can be
wired to any MCP client (OpenClaw, Claude Desktop, cursor, ...):

    laya-mcp-server
    python -m laya.mcp.server

Environment (same meaning as laya.serve where it exists):
  LAYA_DEVICE   torch device for the checkpoints (value goes straight to torch)
  LAYA_PRELOAD  "0" to build the checkpoints lazily instead of at startup (default on)
  LAYA_MODELS   comma list to preload; MCP default is "english,multilingual" so
                typed-decisions stays lazy (in laya.serve an empty value preloads all)
  LAYA_THREADS  cap torch intra-op threads (CPU inference); keep <= physical cores
  LAYA_AUTO_TASK  "1" lets a request auto-route to the typed-decisions checkpoint
                  (same as laya.serve). It does not preload it: LAYA_MODELS still
                  decides what is built at startup.
