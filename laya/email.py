"""Email utilities for cleaning and structuring email inputs in laya.

The markers below cover English, Portuguese and Spanish mail clients. The Router already sends
Portuguese and Spanish states to the multilingual checkpoint, but with English-only markers their
cleaning was a no-op: Gmail's `Em ... escreveu:`, Outlook's `-----Mensagem original-----`, the
`Atenciosamente` sign-off and the confidentiality footer all reached the model, and the quoted
history (often a *different* request) weighed on the answer as much as the new message did.
