"""The `compile=True` path: `torch.compile` over the whole decision model, without per-shape recompiles.

Laya's forward sees a new (rows, tokens, markers) shape on almost every call. Under
`torch.compile(model)` with its defaults that costs, on an RTX 4070 (measured in #472):

* one recompile at the second distinct shape, because the first compile is static and only the
  recompile switches to dynamic shapes ("automatic dynamic"): ~18 s;
* one more for every request that breaks a "duck sizing" guard. Dynamo gives two dimensions
  that happen to be equal at trace time one symbol and then guards on them staying equal, so a
  first call with four questions of four options (rows == markers == 4) recompiles, ~25 s, as
  soon as they differ.

`compile_model` compiles with `dynamic=True`, which removes the first, and `independent_dims()`
switches duck sizing off while a compiled forward runs, which removes the second: every dimension
of Laya's inputs is independent, so each gets its own symbol. What is left is torch's own 0/1
specialisation, one extra graph the first time a single-row batch arrives.

`use_duck_shape` is read when a graph is traced, which happens lazily inside a call, so it cannot be
set once at load and restored. It is set for the duration of each compiled forward instead. In older
torch (2.11, for one) the setting is process-global, so it is put back to whatever it was when the
last call returns (refcounted, so concurrent calls on several threads do not restore it early); newer
torch (2.14) keeps config overrides per thread (a `ContextVar` per entry), so each call sets and
restores its own thread's value with the config's `patch`. Nothing is left changed between calls.

Mode and device are unchanged from what `compile=True` has always done: the default inductor mode,
on whatever device the agent runs on, CPU included.
