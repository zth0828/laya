# Research

Benchmark harnesses and raw results for the Laya checkpoints. This branch is the evidence behind
the numbers quoted in the main README — nothing here is imported by the `laya` package.

## Evaluation

- [`eval/`](eval/README.md): the independent per-language MASSIVE harness (`laya_eval.py`), the per-case
  report behind the published numbers, plus the metamorphic and presentation checks.
- [`evals/`](evals/README.md): the labelled datasets, thresholds and regression gate consumed by
  `laya.evals` / `laya-evals` and the scheduled `evals` workflow.

## Community diagnostics

- [Chinese workplace decisions (Feishu-style)](benchmarks/feishu_zh/README.md) — 64 synthetic scenarios, paired recorded Laya/Jev responses, English/Chinese cards, and a model-free audit. [中文入口](benchmarks/feishu_zh/README.zh-CN.md). Start with `python research/benchmarks/feishu_zh/audit.py`; no downloads or API keys required. This is a contributed historical snapshot, separate from the upstream sweeps below.
- [Chinese short-command routing](benchmarks/zh_short_commands/README.md) — 18 frozen Chinese voice commands, a seven-rung ablation of the documented prompt guidance on both the six-way `choice` path and the four-question `noul` path, and every per-case decision archived. [中文入口](benchmarks/zh_short_commands/README.zh-CN.md). Start with `python research/benchmarks/zh_short_commands/audit.py`; the audit needs no downloads and the archive records which weights produced the numbers.

## Scripts

| file | what it does |
|---|---|
| `scripts/laya_benchmark_colab.ipynb` | the full head-to-head on a Colab T4: typed-decisions, MASSIVE intent + scenario (14 languages), XNLI (15), English suites, latency, option-order robustness, calibration repair. Writes one JSON. |
| `scripts/build_benchmark_nb.py` | generator for that notebook (edit here, not the `.ipynb`) |
| `scripts/bench_local.py` | CPU sweep: MASSIVE intent across **all 51 languages**, plus typed-decisions on all three checkpoints |
| `scripts/bench_apps.py` | the six application workflows (support triage, email + phishing, guardrails, RAG relevance, moderation, model routing) plus the datasets where public Jev numbers exist |
| `scripts/bench_latency.py` | inference speed including what routing costs: detection overhead, hot path, cold-swap, mixed-language throughput at several `max_loaded` settings |
| `scripts/bench_length_batching.py` | compare upstream contiguous batches with optional length sorting on synthetic tickets, including output consistency and optional fresh-process memory profiles (`psutil` required for memory mode) |
| `scripts/make_plots.py` | renders `assets/laya_benchmark.png` from the result JSONs |
| `scripts/bench_long_context.py` | `laya-multilingual` on long documents: 20 support requests in 8 languages, each placed after 0 to 7,000 tokens of unrelated text, scored at the default limit and at `max_len=8192` |
| `scripts/plot_long_context.py` | renders `assets/long_context_8192.png` from `results/long_context_multilingual.json` |

Everything runs with `USE_TF=0` — `transformers` probes for TensorFlow at import, and when TF is
installed its abseil runtime can deadlock model construction on macOS/Python 3.9.

## Running the harnesses

The checkpoints come from `LAYA_MODELS` (default `~/laya_models`, a directory holding `laya/`,
`laya-multilingual/` and `laya-typed-decisions/`), so a checkout can point them at a local
`models/` copy:

```bash
# from the repository root
LAYA_MODELS=$PWD/models python research/scripts/bench_local.py --langs 10 --per-lang 60 --skip-b
LAYA_MODELS=$PWD/models BENCH_N=80 python research/scripts/bench_apps.py
LAYA_MODELS=$PWD/models python research/scripts/bench_latency.py
```

| option | effect |
|---|---|
| `bench_local.py --langs N` | caps the language list (sorted, so `10` is the first ten codes; `0` = all 51) |
| `bench_local.py --per-lang N` | cases per language (default 120) |
| `bench_local.py --skip-a` / `--skip-b` | run only the typed-decisions half, or only the MASSIVE half |
| `bench_apps.py` with `BENCH_N` | cases per application suite (default 400) |

`bench_local.py` and `bench_apps.py` write `research/*_benchmark_results.json`, which is
gitignored — the curated runs live in `results/`. Set `HF_HOME` inside the checkout to keep the
dataset cache local.

`bench_local.py` and `bench_latency.py` take the model root from `LAYA_MODELS` rather than assuming
`~/laya_models`, so the harnesses run against a checkout that keeps its weights under `models/`.

## Length batching

[Local CPU measurements](results/length_batching_cpu_20260924.json) compare the original
`predict_batch` method at `1e28ac20c0896b1c37a744cd11f740eb98f8b178` with `sort_by_length=True`.
On 10,000 synthetic English support tickets, the multilingual checkpoint took **1775.71 s
before and 825.09 s after (2.15x)**, including tokenization, collation, inference and decoding.
There were zero choice/action decision changes, zero usage mismatches, and a maximum returned
numeric difference of **0.0001**. This is a throughput workload, not a labeled accuracy test.

The machine was a Ryzen 9 5950X with 64 GiB RAM, Windows 11, CPU float32 and 16 Torch threads.
An unrelated adaptation experiment was running on the GPU. Small tests alternate execution
order over repeated rounds; the 1,000 and 10,000 input tests each have one full timing pair.
The similar-length control showed no regression. GPU, MPS, compiled and TileLang performance
were not measured. Results depend on input lengths, checkpoint, batch size and hardware.

To reproduce, use a fresh Python 3.12 environment and the pinned model snapshot:

```sh
python -m pip install torch==2.9.1 --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cpu
python -m pip install transformers==4.57.1 huggingface_hub==0.36.2 numpy==2.3.5 psutil==7.2.2
python -c "from huggingface_hub import snapshot_download; print(snapshot_download('convaiinnovations/laya', revision='aa8c91ca088ec597df95a0d1c76b3063cb2ae5e8', allow_patterns=['multilingual/*']) + '/multilingual')"
```

Replace `MODEL_DIR` below with the printed checkpoint directory. Start with `--count 16
--rounds 2 --questions 3`, then increase the count. The full CPU comparison takes tens of minutes:

```sh
python research/scripts/bench_length_batching.py MODEL_DIR --count 10000 --batch-size 8 --threads 16 --rounds 1 --output length-10000.json
```

Memory measurements run each mode in a separate process after model warm-up. They sample
process RSS every 10 ms during 64-input inference, excluding model-load transients; short
allocation peaks can be missed. They do not measure the peak memory of the 10,000-input run:

```sh
python research/scripts/bench_length_batching.py MODEL_DIR --count 64 --batch-size 8 --threads 16 --memory-mode original --output memory-original.json
python research/scripts/bench_length_batching.py MODEL_DIR --count 64 --batch-size 8 --threads 16 --memory-mode grouped --output memory-grouped.json
```

## Results

| file | contents |
|---|---|
| `results/t4_colab_benchmark.json` | 17,416 questions on one T4, both checkpoints, identical questions per model |
| `results/long_context_multilingual.json` | the long-document run behind `assets/long_context_8192.png`: every prediction, with device and library versions |
| `results/cpu_51_language_sweep.json` | 51 languages x 2 checkpoints, MASSIVE intent, 20 options |
| `results/cpu_51_language_sweep_clamped.json` | the same 51 languages and 5,100 cases re-run after the temperature clamp, raw temperatures and served temperatures side by side ([#208](https://github.com/NandhaKishorM/laya/issues/208)) |

## Headline findings

**Routing takes Laya from 23 to 45 of 51 languages.** On MASSIVE intent (20 options, random =
0.050) the English checkpoint macro-averages 0.227 and clears 3x random on 23 of 51 languages;
the multilingual checkpoint reaches 0.366 and clears it on 45.

**The English checkpoint's confidence gives no warning when it cannot read the input.** Khmer:
0.000 accuracy at 0.952 mean confidence. Macro ECE 0.733 across 51 languages, with mean
confidence never dropping below 0.885 at any accuracy level. This is why routing has to happen
*before* the forward pass — confidence gating cannot catch it.

**Both checkpoints ship over-confident.** Refitting one temperature per (question type, option
count) on held-out data moves mean ECE 0.466 -> 0.081 (`laya`) and 0.314 -> 0.106
(`laya-multilingual`, which ships with no fitted temperatures at all).

**The base checkpoints are near chance on typed-decisions zero-shot** — 0.362 and 0.352 against
a 0.318 random baseline and a 0.461 majority-class baseline. The published 0.766 belongs to the
checkpoint fine-tuned on that benchmark's own training split.

**Speed.** 32.8 ms for one question and 7.2 ms/question at batch 10 on a T4; 103–332 questions/s
batched.

## On comparisons with Jev

For the original upstream suites listed above, **Jev was not run directly**. Their Jev
figures are third-party published, with different sample sizes and prompts. The separate
community diagnostic linked above includes paired API responses and documents its own limitations:

- [AbdelStark/jev-benchmarks](https://github.com/AbdelStark/jev-benchmarks) — AG News 0.910,
  Banking77 0.870, DAIR Emotion 0.480 (Brier 0.846, NLL 5.588, zero probability on the true label
  for 16% of examples)
- [nibzard/decision-model-benchmark](https://github.com/nibzard/decision-model-benchmark) — ECE
  0.246 (worst in that study), banking77 0.763, option-order flip rate 13%, latency 264–276 ms p50

Treat those as indicative, not a controlled head-to-head.
