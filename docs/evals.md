# Evaluation harness

`laya.evals` turns a labelled dataset into a repeatable score, and a baseline into a
pass/fail gate, so a quality change is a reviewable diff instead of a hand-check.

The metric math and the dataset parser are pure Python plus numpy and never import torch, so
they run with no weights. Running a dataset against a checkpoint needs the checkpoint and
takes its normal load time.

## Quickstart

```bash
# check the format without a model
laya-evals validate research/evals/fixture.jsonl

# score a labelled set on one checkpoint, with thresholds and a baseline
laya-evals run data.jsonl --model english --device cpu \
    --min-accuracy 0.8 --max-ece 0.05 --score-within 0.25 --slice language \
    --json report.json --markdown report.md

# compare a saved report to a baseline
laya-evals compare report.json --baseline baseline.json --tolerance choice_accuracy=0.02
```

`laya eval ...` is the same thing through the main CLI, so `laya eval validate data.jsonl`
works too.

Exit codes: `0` on success, `1` when a threshold or a baseline tolerance fails, `2` on a
usage error. `run` prints the overall metrics and any requested slices to stdout, and writes
the full report and a Markdown summary when `--json` / `--markdown` are given.

## Evaluating an ONNX export

`run --onnx PATH` scores an exported ONNX model through `ONNXAgent` instead of the torch
Router, so an ONNX deployment (including an INT8 copy from `scripts/export_onnx.py --quantize`)
gets gated by the same thresholds and baselines as the torch path:

```bash
python scripts/export_onnx.py --model convaiinnovations/laya --output laya.onnx --quantize
laya-evals run data.jsonl --onnx laya.int8.onnx --max-ece 0.05
```

`--model` names the checkpoint the export came from — a Hub id or local path, not a Router
short name like `english`, since there is no Router on this path (default
`convaiinnovations/laya`). Its config and tokenizer are loaded from there. The agent serves one checkpoint, so a dataset row
whose `model` field names a different one fails with a clear error rather than being silently
answered by the wrong model; `--device` does not apply. `--batch-size` uses the agent's batch
API when it has one and falls back to one call per state otherwise. The report's `config` block
records the `onnx` path.

Measured on `research/evals/fixture.jsonl` (12 labelled rows, English checkpoint, CPU):

| runner | choice_acc | noul_acc | score_mae | ece | mean_conf | p50 ms |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| torch Router | 0.75 | 1.00 | 1.3418 | 0.1596 | 0.7304 | 116.8 |
| `--onnx` fp32 | 0.75 | 1.00 | 1.3418 | 0.1596 | 0.7304 | 66.3 |
| `--onnx` int8 | 0.75 | 1.00 | 1.3512 | 0.1658 | 0.7304 | 46.3 |

The fp32 export reproduces the torch numbers exactly, and the quantized copy moves `score_mae`
by 0.009 and `ece` by 0.006 — the kind of drift `compare --tolerance` is meant to gate.

## Dataset format

One JSON object per line (JSONL). Blank lines and lines starting with `#` are ignored.

| field | required | meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `state` | yes | text, email, ticket or JSON document to decide on |
| `questions` | yes | a Laya question dict, exactly as `Router.predict` accepts |
| `expected` | yes | ground truth keyed by question id: a label for `choice`, a number for `score`, `true`/`false` for `noul` |
| `tags` | no | strings to slice by |
| `language` | no | a code to slice by |
| `model` | no | force a checkpoint for this row; `--model` overrides it. A row that forces nothing is labelled with whatever checkpoint the `Router` answered with |

`research/evals/dataset.template.jsonl` has a commented example.

## Metrics

Each metric is computed per answer where it applies and aggregated over the dataset:

| metric | applies to | meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `choice_accuracy` | `choice` | fraction whose chosen label matches |
| `noul_accuracy` | `noul` | fraction whose boolean (probability >= 0.5) matches |
| `score_mae` | `score` | mean absolute error |
| `score_within_<tol>` | `score` | fraction within an absolute tolerance |
| `ece` | any answer with a confidence | expected calibration error, 15 bins, computed on `answer["answer_confidence"]`, the calibrated probability Laya reports on every answer type |
| `mean_confidence` | any answer with a confidence | mean reported `answer["answer_confidence"]` |
| `latency_p50_ms`, `latency_p95_ms` | per request | wall time each request waited, informational -- see [batching](#batching-and-timing) |
| `cost_per_decision_p50_ms`, `cost_per_decision_p95_ms` | per decision | a call's wall time divided by the rows it carried, informational |

Add `ScoreWithin(0.25)` to the evaluator list for a tolerance metric; the default set is
`choice_accuracy`, `noul_accuracy`, `score_mae`, `mean_confidence`, plus `ece`. From the CLI the
same thing is one flag: `laya-evals run data.jsonl --score-within 0.25` reports `score_within_0.25`
beside the defaults, and the flag repeats, so `--score-within 0.25 --score-within 0.5` reports both.

A tolerance metric needs a `score` answer with a numeric label, so on a dataset without one it has
no value: `run` names the metric it could not compute instead of publishing a silent zero, and a
`--min` / `--max` gate naming that metric fails as missing. The tolerances a run was asked for are
recorded in the report's `config` block, so a reviewed baseline says which columns it expects.

## Batching and timing

`--batch-size N` scores up to N consecutive rows that share a checkpoint and a question schema in
one call. Both timing metrics come from the same measurements and answer different questions:
every row of a batch returns when the batch does, so its `latency` is the whole call, while its
`cost_per_decision` is `1/N` of it. Batching therefore *raises* `latency_*` and *lowers*
`cost_per_decision_*` on an unchanged set of decisions, and `--max latency_p50_ms=...` asks whether
requests were served fast, not whether the run was cheap. With no `--batch-size` the two agree.

`compare` ignores any `*_ms` metric unless a tolerance names it, so these never fail a baseline on
timing noise. What the harness actually did -- the batch size asked for, the runner shape it
resolved to, how many rows shared a call, and the largest chunk -- is recorded in the report's
`config.timing`, because the flag alone does not say whether anything was batched. Those counters
record the calls issued, not the calls that returned: with `on_error=skip`, a chunk whose call
raised still counts in `rows_grouped` and `max_chunk`, next to its entries in `config.errored`. The
two `*_ms` metrics count only the calls that returned, so a failed call never contributes a latency
it did not measure.

## Slices

`compare` and `run` report overall numbers and, for `--slice language|model|qid|tag`, the same
metrics per slice value, so a regression in one language or one question is visible without
reading the aggregate. The `model` slice holds the checkpoint that answered each row: the
`Router`'s own choice per request, or the runner's `model` for a runner that does not route.

## Baseline and CI gate

- Keep the dataset, a baseline report (`--json` output you have reviewed), and the tolerances
  together, committed, so a change is a reviewable diff. `--tolerance METRIC=VALUE` is the
  maximum absolute drift allowed for that metric.
- `laya-evals run ... --baseline baseline.json --tolerance ...` exits non-zero on drift, so it
  drops into CI unchanged. `laya.evals.EvalReport.compare` and `assert_regression` expose the
  same logic for tests.

Two CI surfaces use this:

- a weight-free job in `.github/workflows/ci.yml` runs `tests/test_evals.py` and
  `tests/test_evals_api.py`, so metric math, dataset parsing and the CLI are covered on every
  PR without downloading a checkpoint;
- `.github/workflows/evals.yml` runs weekly, before a release and on demand: it evaluates the
  English checkpoint on the MASSIVE English suite and compares to
  `research/results/eval_english_51_languages.json` with the tolerances in
  `research/evals/thresholds.json`. It uploads the report as an artifact and does not block a
  PR.

The harness is deterministic for a fixed checkpoint revision, so a report is reproducible.
`run` records the dataset, model and device, plus the [timing](#batching-and-timing) facts of the
run, in the report's `config` block, and `revisions`: the commit each checkpoint that answered was
actually loaded from. `--revision <SHA>` pins that commit for every checkpoint the run loads, and
`--revision english=<SHA>` pins one checkpoint (repeatable) — which is the form an auto-routing run
wants, since the three checkpoints are three repositories and one commit cannot exist in all of
them. Left unpinned, the run takes the checkpoint's default branch and the report still says which
commit answered, so a baseline drift can be attributed to the weights or to the code.
`laya/revisions.py` publishes reviewed commit SHAs in `PINNED_REVISIONS` for callers who want to
opt in. With `--onnx`, only a bare `--revision <SHA>` applies, to the config and tokenizer download.

## Adding the real labelled set

Drop a JSONL in `research/evals/` and a reviewed baseline beside it, then point a workflow (or
`research/evals/check_regression.py`) at both. The format is the same as the fixture; nothing in
the harness knows about MASSIVE.
