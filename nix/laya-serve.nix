        Autocast dtype on CUDA, overriding the checkpoint's own `amp_dtype`
        (sets `LAYA_CUDA_AMP`). Which tokens mean something is decided by
        `laya.agent`, not here: `tests/test_packaging.py` reads them out of the
        runtime and fails if this text drifts from it, which is why there is no
        `enum` on this option. The recognised spellings are `fp16`, `float16`,
        `bf16` and `bfloat16` — the first two name one dtype and the last two
        another. Anything else is ignored rather than an error, and the
        checkpoint's own choice stays in force.

        The type allows any single token but refuses whitespace, which is not
        style: the runtime lower-cases the value and then compares it without
        trimming, so a trailing space keeps full precision and says nothing.

      description = ''
        Run CPU inference under autocast (sets `LAYA_CPU_AMP`). CPU is the one
        device where the runtime does not do this by default: reduced precision
        on CPU only pays where the hardware has a native BF16 path. The
        accepted spellings are `bf16` and `bfloat16`, and nothing else —
        deliberately narrower than `cudaAmp`, which additionally takes a
        half-precision spelling that means nothing on CPU. A value the runtime
        does not recognise leaves CPU in fp32 rather than raising, and
        `tests/test_packaging.py` derives both device sets from `laya.agent`,
        so this sentence is checked in both directions rather than trusted.

        On a host without a native BF16 path this costs several times the fp32
        latency for the same decision: measured at 137 ms -> 744 ms on one
        single-row request, answer unchanged. Set it only where the hardware is
        known to want it. null keeps CPU at full precision.

      description = ''
        Smallest batch that runs under fp16 autocast on MPS (sets
        `LAYA_MPS_AMP_MIN_ROWS`). MPS autocast is decided per call rather than
        once at load: casting costs more than the matmul saves on a single
        small row, and starts to win once a batch has several, so the runtime
        holds short requests in fp32 and long ones in fp16. This option moves
        that crossover for the whole service.

        There is no value that is simply better, which is why the default is
        null and not a number. Measured on an Apple-silicon host with the
        `english` checkpoint: forcing the threshold to 1 made a one-row request
        42% slower (31.8 ms -> 45.1 ms), while pushing it past the largest
        batch the service sees made an eight-row batch 71% slower
        (83.5 ms -> 142.7 ms) — the two settings trade the same two cases
        against each other. The reported answer was unchanged either way.

        `ints.positive` rather than `ints.unsigned`: the runtime clamps a value
        below 1 up to 1, so this refuses at evaluation time the one input the
        service would otherwise reinterpret. null leaves the runtime's own
        threshold in place.

        Checkpoints to preload at startup. All three fit comfortably in a 24 GB
        card (~1.16B params total), so the default keeps every one hot and makes
        language routing free.

        The names are validated by laya rather than by this module: the list is
        joined into `LAYA_MODELS`, and the server normalises every entry with
        `laya.router.normalise_name`, which accepts `english`, `multilingual` and
        `typed-decisions` plus the aliases `en`, `laya`, `default`, `multi`, `ml`,
        `laya-multilingual`, `typed`, `typed_decisions`, `laya-typed-decisions` and
        `decisions`. An unknown name stops the service at startup with an error
        listing all of them. An `enum` here could only copy that list and fall

        host's *physical* core count — oversubscribing the logical/hyperthread
        count is a large latency regression. For single-request latency, a value
        below the core count (e.g. 8-16) is often fastest; for batched

        this is unset, logs a line per request, so on a busy decision endpoint it
        is most of the unit's journal traffic; `warning` keeps startup and errors.
        Not an `enum` over those names: uvicorn checks the value, and a copy here

        bounded. Lower it on a host where a queue of forwards is worse
        than a refusal — measured on the `english` checkpoint, CPU, 16
        simultaneous requests: the median accepted request answered in 64 ms at a
        cap of 1 and 542 ms at 16, and 15 of 16 were refused in under 0.1 ms at
        that cap against none at 16. So the knob trades the latency of the
