# Contributing

Thanks for helping improve Laya. This guide keeps reviews fast and the history clean.

By taking part you agree to the [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## Scope

Laya is a fast, local, on-device decision engine. Keep additions in that spirit: they should run
in the user's own process or on their own hardware, with no dependency on a hosted service or an
external API. A feature that only works against a hosted backend is out of scope for the core
package; it belongs in a separate integration or a community project.

## Ways to contribute

- Report a bug with the bug report template.
- Request or discuss a feature with the feature request template.
- Improve the docs under [`docs/`](docs/index.md), including the [hooks guide](docs/hooks/index.md).
- Fix a bug or add a feature with a focused pull request.
- Share benchmarks, evaluations, or integration reports, which the project treats as first class.

## Development setup

Laya supports Python 3.10 to 3.13. Use a virtual environment so nothing leaks into your system.

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -e ".[mcp]"
```

Optional extras are declared in `pyproject.toml`: `serve`, `fast`, `onnx`, `langchain`, `langgraph`.
Install the ones a change needs, for example `pip install -e ".[serve]"`.

If you use [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/), the same setup is below. uv environments come without
`pip`, so use `uv pip install` wherever this guide says `pip install`.

```bash
uv venv --python 3.12
source .venv/bin/activate
uv pip install -e ".[mcp]"
```

The server and ONNX paths are exercised by `tests/test_serve.py` and `tests/test_onnx.py`, which
skip when their extras are not installed.

## Running the tests

Most suites are plain scripts, so no test runner is required:

```bash
python tests/test_router.py
python tests/test_criteria.py
python tests/test_hooks.py
python tests/test_hooks_api.py
```

A few are pytest based and run with `python -m pytest tests/test_serve.py`, `tests/test_onnx.py`
and `tests/test_truncation_direction.py`.

The full set, including the ones the CI runs, is in [`.github/workflows/ci.yml`](.github/workflows/ci.yml).
A handful of suites need hardware or local weights and are skipped otherwise: `tests/test_fast.py`
needs CUDA, and `tests/test_local_e2e.py` and `tests/test_mcp_local_e2e.py` expect checkpoints under
`~/laya_models`.

Before opening a pull request, run the lint and compile checks the CI runs:

```bash
ruff check laya/ --select=E9,F63,F7,F82,F401,F811 --line-length=120
python -m compileall -q laya/ tests/
```

## Documentation

The site at [nandhakishorm.github.io/laya](https://nandhakishorm.github.io/laya/) builds from
`docs/` with Zensical, and its API reference builds from the docstrings in `laya/`. A new page
appears under Guides without a config change; to put it somewhere else, add it to
[`docs/.nav.yml`](docs/.nav.yml). For a docs or docstring change, build the site the way the CI
does:

```bash
pip install -r requirements-docs.txt
zensical build --strict --clean
```

The output must have no `griffe:` lines. Those are docstring problems, such as a parameter the
signature does not have, and the CI fails on them.

## Style

- Keep the public API stable. If a change must move it, update `tests/test_hooks_api.py` in the same
  pull request, because that suite is the API contract.
- Prefer the standard library and what is already a dependency over a new one.
- Leave one runnable check behind for non-trivial logic: an assert based script is enough.
- Comment only where the code cannot say it, usually a non-obvious reason or a hardware caveat.
- Match the surrounding style rather than a personal preference.

## Commits

Use conventional commit prefixes, matching the history:

```
feat(agent): ...
fix(router): ...
perf(common): ...
docs(hooks): ...
test(batch): ...
```

Keep one logical change per commit. A focused pull request is much easier to review and merge than a
large one, and it is fine to split a big change into several PRs.

## Pull requests

The template asks for four things; filling them in is what makes review quick:

1. **What** changed.
2. **Why**, ideally the concrete use case, not only the mechanism.
3. **How it was verified**: the exact commands you ran.
4. Any follow-ups you deliberately left out.

Before you open one:

- Rebase onto the latest `main`, so the diff is only your change.
- Keep it focused; split unrelated work into another PR.
- Update docs or examples when the public API changes.
- Do not commit secrets, tokens, or large binary files.

If your change moves numbers, report the before and after: the maintainer verifies decisions against
real checkpoints, and measured deltas (probability changes, latency, memory) are what gets a change
merged.

## Reporting issues

The project is maintained in English, so please write issues in English when you can; it is the
common language for everyone reading and triaging.

Use the issue templates and include:

- What you expected and what you got.
- A minimal reproduction, ideally a short script.
- Your Laya version (`python -c "import laya; print(laya.__version__)"`), Python version, OS, and
  device or backend (CPU, CUDA, MPS, ONNX).

## Reviews

Reviewers may ask you to rebase, to split a change, or to add a regression test. Those are the
normal asks in this repository, not a rejection. If you disagree with a request, say so on the PR
and explain the tradeoff.
