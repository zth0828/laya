"""The CVE audit job must see every name the package declares, not just the core five.

`.github/workflows/security.yml` builds `requirements-audit.txt` from `pyproject.toml` and hands it
to `pip-audit`. For a while it did that with a regex anchored on `dependencies = [`, which matches
the `[project]` array and none of `[project.optional-dependencies]` -- so the ten names behind the
`serve`, `fast`, `mcp`, `structured`, `onnx`, `langchain` and `langgraph` extras, and the 57
transitive names they pull in, were outside the audit. `Dockerfile` ends with
`pip install ".[serve]" && pip check`: the HTTP server's dependencies ship in the published image.

Text parsing, not tomllib: the floor is 3.10 and tomllib arrives in 3.11, same as
`tests/test_packaging.py`. The job that runs the extractor pins `python-version: "3.11"`, which is
checked here, and the lifted code is only executed where tomllib exists -- on 3.10 that check
degrades to a note and never to a pass.
