"""Every autocast-dtype override the runtime reads has to be reachable from the shipped Compose
deployment.

`laya/agent.py` picks the dtype a forward runs in from the environment, and the deployment that
selects the device drops those names:

    $ LAYA_CUDA_AMP=fp16 docker compose -f compose.yaml -f compose.cuda.yaml config | grep LAYA_
          LAYA_DEVICE: cuda
          LAYA_DEVICE: cuda

The operator exported the variable, Compose saw it, and neither service's environment carries it,
so the image serves the checkpoint's own `amp_dtype` no matter what was set. That is not a
rounding difference: README's threshold section measures, on the `parity_fast.py` set (60 states,
288 questions per checkpoint, RTX 2000 Ada), bf16 flipping 3 of 864 argmaxes against the fp32
forward where fp16 flips none, at the same latency. The dtype is a policy dial, and the published
deployment could not turn it.

Why the names are derived rather than transcribed: the same three-way drift (package, markdown,
Compose) is what hid them, and a literal list in this file goes stale the moment the core reads
another one. So the set is read out of `laya/agent.py` -- the names it consumes *near a dtype
decision* -- and the rest of the file checks the deployment and the page against it, in both
directions. `LAYA_MPS_AMP_MIN_ROWS` is read by the same module and is deliberately not required
here, because no image in this repo can select MPS; check 5 keeps that reason falsifiable instead
of freezing it in a comment.

Weight-free, torch-free, no third-party YAML: the same textual style as the Compose section of
`tests/test_packaging.py`. The one docker-dependent check degrades to a note when docker is absent
and never to a pass.
