"""Regression: examples/server.py must bound a request the way laya.serve does.

`laya/serve.py` refuses a request carrying more than MAX_QUESTIONS questions, a state
over MAX_STATE_CHARS, or a body over its own cap, because Laya encodes the state once
per question -- cost is questions x state size, collated into one tensor.

examples/server.py bounded `states` to 64 and left the rest open: 20 000 questions and
a 5 MB state were both accepted where the shipped server answers 413. The bounds are
read from laya.serve rather than restated, so the two cannot drift.

Scope: the question count, the state size, and the per-question and total option counts,
answered 413 as laya.serve answers them. The option budgets matter for the same reason the
other two do -- a choice or score question encodes one sequence per option, and those
sequences share the head budget -- so a request laya.serve refuses with 413 must not be
answered here. The bounds are read from laya.serve, never restated.
`Question.instructions` and `criteria` still carry unbounded *text* that no per-field
bound can see; capping the request body is the backstop for those and is left out
deliberately -- see the PR description.

Driven over HTTP through TestClient. No weights are loaded; the router stays unbuilt, so
a request that passes validation answers 503, which is the assertion for "accepted". The
one arm that needs a Router enters the lifespan, which is also the arm that checks the cap.

On `main` this file is 19 checks, all of them about request size. It is now 38: the other
nineteen follow the cap from the environment to the constructor, to the running Router, to
`/health` in both JSON and HTML, and back out through the `--reload` push. The first
nineteen are untouched.

FAILS_ON_MAIN -- this file, against `main`'s `examples/server.py` at 4066d5d:

    PASS the page and health endpoints are unaffected
    FAIL an unset LAYA_MAX_LOADED means 'not asked for', not a number of this file's own  1
    AttributeError: module 'server' has no attribute '_router_kwargs'

One check names the number, then the run aborts because the helper it drives does not exist
there. So the same claims are checked on `main` through nothing but the public surface -- its
own lifespan, the Router that builds, `/health` in both representations -- which prints:

    Router()'s own default = 2      built Router's cap = 1      /health JSON = 1
    /health HTML says      = 'Checkpoints are loaded on demand; up to 1 kept in memory.'
    preload() lifts the cap to -> 3, while the page prints 1

and `False` for "the cap came from the environment", "the Router holds laya's default", and
"that default is more than one"; on this branch all three read `True` and the cap reads 2.
That last line is the half that is not about the default at all: `Router.preload()` raises the
cap to fit what it preloads (`laya/router.py:275` -> `:372`), so the demo's own default mode ran
with three checkpoints resident while `/health` reported one. Nothing in the file ever asked the
running Router what it was holding.
