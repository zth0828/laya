"""predict_long: scan a state longer than the window and aggregate per question.

Weight-free. The real forward path is stubbed (predict_batch returns canned per-window answers),
so this checks only predict_long's own logic: the fits-in-one-window short-circuit, the overlapping
window split, the per-type aggregation (noul = strongest window, choice/score = most-confident
window), and the per-call hook controls it forwards to whichever of those two calls runs. Numerical
behaviour on real weights is exercised in tests/test_local_e2e.py.
