"""Email cleaning: a disclaimer footer must not delete the sender's actual request.

Regression tests for `laya.email.clean_email_body`. `_DISCLAIMER` used to be applied to whole
paragraphs, so any paragraph that merely *mentioned* boilerplate was deleted outright. When the
footer ran on without a blank line, the request went with it:

    clean_email_body("My account is locked.\\nThis email is confidential...\\nPlease unlock it.")
    # before: ''      <- the whole body, request included, was deleted
    # after:  'My account is locked. Please unlock it.'

Dropping the request is silent and severe; leaving one boilerplate line behind is neither, so the
cleaning errs towards keeping text.

The same asymmetry drives the sign-off tests below. `_SIGNATURE_MARKERS` allowed a whole
sentence behind the closing word, so an ordinary body line beginning with one of them was read
as the start of a signature and everything after it was cut:

    clean_email_body("Hi,\\n\\nThanks for the quick reply.\\nCould you refund invoice 4411?")
    # before: 'Hi,'    <- the request was cut away

The last block guards a different kind of silence. `email_questions` was defined twice, here and
in `laya/presets.py`, and `laya/__init__.py` re-exports the `presets` one. Editing the copy in
`laya/email.py` moved `laya.email.email_questions` and left `laya.email_questions` where it was,
with no test and no lint failing.

The block at the end is the same shape again: `clean_email_body` takes a `max_chars` budget and
`email_state` cut every body to its default, so a request in the last paragraphs of a long email was
deleted before the model saw it -- while the keyword a caller would use to stop that,
`email_state(..., max_chars=8000)`, fell into `**extra` and became a field of the state instead.

# --------------------------------- email_state owns the body budget (a `clean_email_body` control)
# `clean_email_body(body, max_chars=...)` takes a budget and `email_state` called it with none, so
# the state was always cut at 3000 characters with no lever. The one call a reader reaches for,
# `email_state(subject, body, max_chars=8000)`, went to `**extra` instead, which merges the keyword
# into the state that `serialize_state` renders into the model's input: the budget stayed at 3000
# and a `"max_chars": 8000` field was added to what the checkpoint reads.
